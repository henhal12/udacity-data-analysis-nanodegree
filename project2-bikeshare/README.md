# US Bikeshare Project

<b> Interactive python program to uncover bike share usage patterns in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. </b></br>
</br>
Dataset is provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States.

# The Datasets:
The Datasets contain these 6 columns:

 <li>Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57) </li></br>
 <li>End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53) </li></br>
 <li>Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776) </li></br>
 <li>Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave) </li></br>
 <li>End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave) </li></br>
 <li>User Type (Subscriber or Customer)</li></br>
</br>
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:</br>
</br>
 <li>Gender </li></br>
 <li>Birth Year </li>

# Statistics Computed:

This project will learn about bike share usage patterns by computing a variety of descriptive statistics.

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

<li>most common month </li></br>
<li>most common day of week </li></br>
<li>most common hour of day</li>

#2 Popular stations and trip

<li>most common start station </li></br>
<li>most common end station </li></br>
<li>most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

<li>total travel time</li> </br>
<li>average travel time</li>

#4 User info

<li>counts of each user type</li> </br>
<li>counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)</li> </br>
<li>earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)</li>
